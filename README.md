# Mars Exploration Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that are used for scraping and analyzing data related to Mars. These projects involve web scraping using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Splinter, followed by data analysis using Pandas and data visualization using Matplotlib.

### Part 1: Mars News Scraping
In the first part, the goal is to scrape the latest news about Mars from a designated website. The script extracts titles and preview texts of news articles and stores them for further analysis.

### Part 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis
The second part involves scraping Mars temperature and atmospheric pressure data from another website. The script then processes this data to perform various analyses, such as identifying the coldest and warmest months on Mars and analyzing atmospheric pressure trends.

## Setup and Installation
To run these notebooks, you will need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- BeautifulSoup4
- Splinter
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You will also need a driver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) to use with Splinter for automated web browsing.

## Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that all required libraries are installed.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in an environment that can run them (like Jupyter Lab or VSCode).
4. Run the cells in each notebook sequentially to see the results of the data scraping and analysis.
